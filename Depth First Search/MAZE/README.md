**Introduction:**
Depth-First Traversal (DFS) Concept:
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
It starts from a selected node (or starting point) and visits all reachable nodes as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.
DFS uses a stack (or recursion) to keep track of nodes to be visited.
At each step, it pops a node from the stack, marks it as visited, and then explores its adjacent unvisited nodes.
The process continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

Application of DFS to Mazes:
In a maze represented as a graph, each cell is a node, and adjacent cells connected by passages are connected by edges.
DFS can be applied to navigate through the maze to find a path from the start position to the destination.
The algorithm starts at the start position, explores one possible direction as far as possible, and backtracks if it reaches a dead-end or the destination.
It continues this process until it reaches the destination or exhausts all possible paths.
DFS is well-suited for solving mazes because it explores one path as deeply as possible before trying alternative paths.

Application of DFS to Trees:
In the context of trees, DFS can be used to traverse the tree nodes in a depth-first manner.
There are two common DFS strategies for trees: Pre-order DFS and In-order DFS.
Pre-order DFS: Visit the current node, then recursively visit the left subtree, and finally, recursively visit the right subtree.
In-order DFS: Recursively visit the left subtree, then visit the current node, and finally, recursively visit the right subtree.
DFS is useful in scenarios where we need to explore the tree in a specific order, such as printing nodes in a particular sequence or searching for specific elements.

**Overview:**
The problem statement is to determine if a ball can reach the destination in a maze. The maze is represented as a 2D matrix of size MxN, where each cell is either a 0 (empty space) or a 1 (wall). The ball can move up, down, left, or right, but it can't go through walls. The ball starts at a given starting position, and the destination is another cell in the matrix. We need to find if the ball can reach the destination by navigating through the maze.
